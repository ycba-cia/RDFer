<h1>Eyeball: checking RDF/OWL for common problems</h1>

Eyeball is a Jena contrib for checking RDF models (including OWL) for
common problems. It is user-extensible using plugins. The available 
documentation for this Eyeball, E2.3, is:

<ul>
<li>This index and one-minute introduction.
<li>The <a href="brief.html">brief guide</a>.
<li>The <i>experimental</i> <a href="gui.html">Eyeball GUI</a>.
<li>The full <a href="full.html">manual</a>.
<li>The <a href="javadoc/index.html">javadoc</a>.
</ul>

You can download Eyeball from the
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=40417&package_id=148927">
Eyeball package page</a>. Eyeball needs Java 5 or later to run.

<h1>one-minute introduction</h1>

<h2>installation</h2>

<p>
If you haven't already, download Eyeball from the
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=40417&package_id=148927">Eyeball package page</a>
and unzip it into a directory of your choice.
The download is rather large, because Eyeball 2.3 includes the Jena
jars so that it runs stand-alone.

<p>If you have Ant installed, run the Eyeball test suite:

<blockquote>
ant test 
</blockquote>

<p>
If it doesn't say that the tests passed, let us know via the jena-dev
mailing list <i>jena-dev@groups.yahoo.com</i> (registration required)
and we'll see what we can do to fix the problem.

<p>Ensure all the jars in the Eyeball lib directory are on your classpath.
(You might find <a href="classpath.text">this list</a> helpful.)

<h2>trying it out</h2>

<p>
Pick one of your RDF files; we'll call it FOO for now. Run the command-line
command:

<blockquote>
java jena.eyeball -check FOO
</blockquote>

<p>
You will likely get a whole bunch
of messages about your RDF. The messages are supposed to be self-explanatory,
so you may be able to go ahead and fix some problems straight away. If you 
get a Java error about <b>NoClassDefFoundError</b>, you've forgotten to
set the classpath up or use the <i>-cp myClassPath</i> option to Java.

<p>(You may also want to try the experimental <a href="gui.html">Eyeball GUI</a>,
but you'll still need to start it from the command line.)

<p>
If the messages aren't self-explanatory, or you want more details, 
you'll want to move on to the <a href="brief.html">brief guide</a>.
