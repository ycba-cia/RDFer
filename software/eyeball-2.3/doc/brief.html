<h1>brief guide</h1>

<p>
So you've got Eyeball installed and you've run it on one of your
files, and Eyeball doesn't like it. You're not sure why, or what
to do about it. Here's what's going on.

<p>
Eyeball inspects your model against a set of <i>schemas</i>.
The default set of schemas includes RDF, RDFS, the XSD datatypes,
and any models your model imports: you can add additional schemas
from the command line or configuration file.
Eyeball uses those schemas to work out what URIs count as "declared"
in advance. It also checks URIs and literals for syntactic 
correctness and name space prefixes for being "sensible". 
Let's look at some of the messages you can get.

<h2>unknown predicate reports</h2>

<p>
You'll probably find several messages like this:

<pre>
predicate not declared in any schema: <i>somePredicateURI</i>
</pre>

Eyeball treats the imported models, and (independently) the
specified schemas, as single OntModels, and extracts those
OntModels' properties. It includes the RDF and RDFS schemas.
Anything used as a predicate that isn't one of those properties
is reported.

<p>If you're using OWL, you can silence the "undeclared property"
messages about OWL properties by adding to your Eyeball command line
the option:

<blockquote>
-assume owl
</blockquote>

<p>
Eyeball will read the OWL schema (it has a copy stashed away in the
<i>mirror</i> directory) and add the declared properties to
its known list. This works for any filename or URL you like, so long as 
there's RDF there and it has a suitable file suffix - <i>.n3</i> for 
N3 or <i>.rdf</i> or <i>.owl</i> for RDF/XML - and for the built-in
names <i>dc</i> (basic Dublin Core), <i>dcterms</i> (Dublin Core terms)
and <i>dc-all</i> (both). So you
can construct your own schemas, which declare your own domain-specific
property declarations, and invoke Eyeball with

<blockquote>
-assume owl <i>mySchemaFile.n3</i> <i>otherSchemaFile.rdf</i>
</blockquote>

<p>
You can give short names (like <b>dc</b> and <b>rdfs</b>) to
your own schemas, or collections of schemas, using an Eyeball
<i>config file</i>, but you'll have to see the
<a href="full.html">manual</a> to find out how.

<h2>unknown class reports</h2>

<p>
You may see messages like this:

<pre>
class not declared in any schema: <i>someClassURI</i>
</pre>

<p>
Having read the previous section, you can probably work out
what's going on: Eyeball reads the schemas (and imports) 
and extracts the declared OntClasses. Then anything used
as a class that isn't one of those declared classes is
reported.. 

<p>
And that's exactly it. "Used as a class" means appearing
as <b>C</b> or <b>D</b> in any statement of the form:

<ul>
<li>_ rdf:type C
<li>_ rdfs:domain C
<li>_ rdfs:range C
<li>C rdfs:subClassOf D
</ul>

<h2>suppressing inspectors</h2>

<p>
It may be that you're not interested in the "unknown predicate"
or "unknown class" reports until you've sorted out the URIs.
Or maybe you don't care about them. In that case, you can
switch them off.

<p>
Eyeball's different checks are carried out by <i>inspector</i>
classes. These classes are given short names by entries in 
Eyeball config files (which are RDF files written using N3; you
can see the default config file by looking in Eyeball's 
<code>etc</code> directory for <code>eyeball2-config.n3</code>).
By adding eg:

<blockquote>
-exclude property class
</blockquote>

<p>to the Eyeball command line, you can <i>exclude</i> the inspectors
with those short names from the check. <i>property</i> is the
short name for the "unknown property" inspector, and
<i>class</i> is the short name for the "unknown class"
inspector.

<h2>namespace and URI reports</h2>

Eyeball checks all the URIs in the model, including (if available)
those used for namespaces. (And literals, but see below.) Here's
an example:

<pre>
bad namespace URI: "file:some-filename"
    on prefix: "pqr"
    for reason: file URI inappropriate for namespace
</pre>

A "bad namespace URI" means that Eyeball doesn't like the URI
for a namespace in the model. The "on prefix" part of the
report says what the namespace prefix is, and the "for reason"
part gives the reason. In this case, we (the designer of Eyeball)
feel that it is unwise to use file URIs - which tend to depend
on internal details of your directory structure - for global
concepts.

<p>A more usual reason is that the URI is syntactically illegal.
Here are some possibilities:

<table border>

<tr>
    <td>URI contains spaces
    <td>literal spaces are not legal in URIs. This usually arises from
        file URIs when the file has a space in its name. Spaces in URIs
        have to be encoded. 
   
<tr>
    <td>URI has no scheme
    <td>The URI has no scheme at all. This usually happens when some relative
         URI hasn't been resolved properly, eg there's no xml base in an
         RDF/XML document.
         
<tr>
    <td>URI has an unrecognised scheme
    <td>The scheme part of the URI - the bit before the first colon - isn't
        recognised. Eyeball knows, by default, four schemes: 
        <b>http</b>, <b>ftp</b>, <b>file</b>, and <b>urn</b>. This 
        usually arises when a QName has "escaped" from somewhere, or from
        a typo.
        
        <p>You can tell Eyeball about other schemes, if you need them.

<tr>
    <td>scheme should be lower-case
    <td>The scheme part of the URI contains uppercase letters. While this
        is not actually <i>wrong</i>, it is unconventional and pointless.
        
<tr>
    <td>URI doesn't fit pattern
    <td>Eyeball has some (weak) checks on the syntax of URIs in different
        schemes, expressed as patterns in its config files. If a URI doesn't
        match the pattern, Eyeball reports this problem. At the moment,
        you'll only get this report for a <b>urn</b> URI like
        <i>urn:x-hp:23487682347</i> where the URN id (the bit between the 
        first and second colons, here <i>x-hp</i>) is illegal.
    
<tr>
    <td>URI syntax error
    <td>A catch-all error: Java couldn't make any sense of this URI at all.
    
</table>

<h2>problems with literals</h2>

<p>Eyeball checks literals (using the <i>literal inspector</i>,
whose short name is <b>literal</b> if you want to switch it off),
but the checking is quite weak because it doesn't understand
types at the moment. You can get two different classes of error.

<pre>
bad language: someLanguageCode
on literal: theLiteralInQuestion
</pre>

<p>Literals with language codes (things like <b>en-UK</b> or
<b>de</b>) are checked to make sure that the language code
conforms to the general syntax for language codes: alphanumeric
words separated by hyphens, with the first containing no digits.

<p>(Later versions of Eyeball will likely allow you to specify 
<i>which</i> language codes you want to permit in your models.
But we haven't got there yet.)

<pre>
bad datatype URI: someURI
on literal: theLiteralInQuestion
for reason: theReason
</pre>

<p>Similarly, literals with datatypes are checked to make sure
that the type URI is legal. That's it for the moment: Eyeball
doesn't try to find out if the URI really is a type URI, or
if the spelling of the literal is OK for that type. But it
spots the bad URIs. (The messages are the same as those that
appear in the URI checking - above - for the very good reason
that it's the same code doing the checking.)

<h2>problematic prefixes</h2>

<p>
Both RDF/XML and N3 allow (and RDF/XML requires) namespaces to
be abbreviated by prefixes. Eyeball checks prefixes for two
possible problems. The first:

<pre>
non-standard namespace for prefix
</pre>

<p>
This arises when a "standard" prefix has been bound to a namespace
URI which isn't its usual one. The "standard" prefixes are taken from
Jena's <code>PrefixMapping.Extended</code> and are currently:

<blockquote>
<b>rdf, rdfs, daml, owl, xsd, rss, vcard</b>
</blockquote>

<p>And the second:

<pre>
Jena generated prefix found
</pre>

<p>
This arises when the model contains prefixes of the form <code>j.N</code>,
where N is a number. These are generated by Jena when writing RDF/XML
for URIs that must have a prefix (because they are used as types or
predicates) but haven't been given one. 

<p>
If you're not bothered about inventing short prefixes for your
namespaces, you can <b>-exclude</b> <code>jena-prefix</code>
to suppress this inspection.

<h1>but how do I ...</h1>

<p>The reports described so far are part of Eyeball's default
set of inspections. There are some other checks that it can do
that are switched off by default, because they are expensive,
initially overwhelming, or downright obscure. If you need 
to add these checks to your eyeballing, this is how to do it.
</p>

<h2>... make sure everything is typed?</h2>

<p>
Some applications (or a general notion of cleanliness) require
that every individual in an RDF model has an explicit 
<code>rdf:type</code>. The Eyeball check for this isn't
enabled by default, because lots of casual RDF use doesn't
need it, and more sophisticated use has models with enough
inference power to infer types.

<p>
You can add the <b>all-typed</b> inspector to the inspectors
that Eyeball will run by adding to the command line:

<blockquote>
-inspectors defaultInspectors all-typed
</blockquote>

<p>The <b>all-typed</b> inspector will generate a message

<pre>
resource has no rdf:type
</pre>

<p>for each resource in the model which is not the subject of
an <code>rdf:type</code> statement. 

<h2>... check for type consistency?</h2>

<p>
One easy mistake to make in RDF is to make an assertion - we'll
call it <b>S P O</b> - about some subject <b>S</b> which is 
"of the wrong type", that is, not of whatever type <b>P</b>'s
domain is. This isn't, in principle, an error, since RDF resources 
can have multiple types, and this just makes <b>S</b> have a type
which is a subtype of both <b>P</b>'s domain and whatever type
it was supposed to have.

<p>To spot this, and related problems, Eyeball has the
<b>consistent-type</b> inspector. You can add it to the 
inspections in the same way as the <b>all-typed</b>
inspector:

<blockquote>
-inspectors defaultInspectors consistent-type
</blockquote>

<p>
It checks that every resource which has been given at least
one type has a type which is a subtype of all its types,
under an additional assumption:

<blockquote>
Types in the type graph (the network of rdfs:subClassOf statements)
are disjoint (share no instances) unless the type graph says they're
not. 
</blockquote>

<p>For example, suppose that both <b>A</b> and <b>B</b> are
subclasses of <b>Top</b>, ande that there are no other subclass
relationships. Then <b>consistent-types</b> assumes that there
are (supposed to be) no resources which have both <b>A</b> and
<b>B</b> as types. If it finds a resource <b>X</b> which <i>does</i>
have both types, it generates a message like this:

<pre>
no consistent type for: X
has associated type: A
has associated type: B
has associated type: Top
</pre>

<p>
It's up to you to disentangle the types and work out what went
wrong. 

<p>
<i>Note</i>: this test requires that Eyeball do a significant amount
of inference, to complete the type hierarchy and check the
domains and ranges of proeprties. It's quite slow, which is
one reason it isn't switched on by default. 

<h2>... check the right number of values for a property?</h2>

<p>You want to make sure that your data has the right properties
for things of a certain type: say, that a book has at least one
author (or editor), an album has at least one track, nobody in
your organisation has more than ten managers, a Jena contrib
has at least a <code>dc:creator</code>, a <code>dc:name</code>,
and a <code>dc:description</code>. You write some OWL
<i>cardinality constraints</i>:

<blockquote>
my:Type rdfs:subClassOf [owl:onProperty my:track; owl:minCardinality 1]
</blockquote>

Then you discover that, for wildly technical reasons, the OWL
validation code in Jena doesn't think it's an error for some
album to have no tracks (maybe there's a namespace error).
</p>

<p>You can enable Eyeball's <i>cardinality inspector</i> by
adding

<blockquote>
-inspectors cardinality
</blockquote>

to the command line. You'll now get a report item for every resource
that has <code>rdf:type</code> your restricted type (<code>my:Type</code>
above) but doesn't have the right (at least one) value for the property.
It will look something like:

<pre>
cardinality failure for: my:Instance
    on type: my:Type
    on property: my:track
    cardinality range: [min: 1]
    number of values: 0
    values: {}
</pre>

If there are some values for the property - say you've supplied
an <code>owl:maxCardinality</code> restriction and then gone
over the top - they get listed inside the <code>values</code>
curly braces.
