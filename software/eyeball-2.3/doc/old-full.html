<h1>summary</h1>

This document describes Eyeball 2.1. Changes since 2.0. 1.3, 1.2, 1.1, and 1.0 
are summarised in the release notes: note that the command-line syntax changed
from 1.0 to 1.1, and again from 1.3 to 2.0, and that the experimental GUI is not 
described here.

<h1>Eyeball - checking RDF for common problems</h1>

Eyeball is a library and command-line tool for checking RDF models for 
certain common problems. These problems often result in technically correct 
but implausible RDF. Eyeball checks against user-provided schema files 
and makes various closed-world assumptions.

<p>Eyeball currently can check for:

<ul>
<li>unknown [with respect to the schemas] properties and classes
<li>bad prefix namespaces
<li>ill-formed URIs [including literal datatypes]
<li>ill-formed language tags on literals
<li>datatyped literals with illegal lexical forms
<li>unexpected local names in schema namespaces
<li>untyped resources [including literals]
<li>individuals having consistent types assuming complete typing
<li>subjects that have a different number of values for some property
    than you'd expect from their cardinality-restricted types.
<li>broken RDF list structures
<li>suspected broken use of the typed list idiom
<li>obviously broken OWL restrictions
<li>user-specified constraints written in SPARQL
</ul>

We plan to have Eyeball check for:

<ul>
<li>user-specified constraints on permitted language codes
<li>user-specified constraints on permitted URIs
</ul>

Eyeball's checks are performed by Inspector plug-ins and can be customised
by the user. Rendering its reports to output is performed by Renderer
plug-ins which can also be customised by the user.

<h2>installation</h2>

Fetch the Eyeball distribution zipfile and unpack it somewhere convenient.
Read the documention in the doc/index.html file (that's what this is). 
Eyeball 2.1 comes with its own copy of Jena 2.4 with CVS updates.

<p>In the Eyeball distribution directory, run the Eyeball tests:

<blockquote>
ant test 
</blockquote>

If these tests fail, something is wrong. Sometimes it's no more than
a classpath problem, which you can fix. If not, use the jena-dev mailing
list to request assistance. Note that any support is provided on a voluntary 
basis, as and when the effort is available. 

<p>If the tests have passed, you can copy lib/*.jar to whatever place
you find convenient. You can then use it from the command line or from
within Jena code. You will also need to copy the directories <i>mirror</i>
and <i>etc</i> to somewhere convenient where the Jena FileManager class
can see them.

<h2>command line operation</h2>

You must ensure that the Eyeball jars and the Jena libraries 
-- <i>in that order</i> --
are on your classpath. (Note that a CVS version of Eyeball may
come with its own <code>jena.jar</code> and may not work
with your usual installation.)

<p>Run the command:

<blockquote>
<pre>
java [java options eg classpath and proxy] jena.eyeball 
    [-assume Reference*]
    -check specialURL+
    [-config fileOrURL*]
    [-root rootURL]
    [-render Name]
    [-include shortName*]
    [-exclude shortName*]
</pre>
</blockquote>

The -<i>whatever</i> sections can come in any order and may be repeated,
in which case the new arguments are appended to the existing ones.

<p>The -config fileOrURL options specify the Eyeball assembler file to
load. A single configuration model is constructed as the union of the
contents of those files. If this option is omitted, the config file 
<i>etc/eyeball-config.n3 is loaded</i>. See 
<a href="#load-config-files">loadConfigFiles</a> for details.

<p>The -assume <i>Reference</i>s identifies any assumed schemas used to identify
the predicates and classes of the data model. The reference may be a
file name or a URL; it is loaded by a default FileManager (and hence
respects any FileManager renamings).

<p>Eyeball automatically assumes the RDF and RDFS schemas, and the 
built-in XSD datatype classes. The short name <i>owl</i> can be used 
to refer to the OWL schema, <i>dc</i> to the Dublin Core schema,
<i>dcterms</i> to the Dublin Core terms schema,and <i>dc-all</i> to both.

<p>The <i>specialURL</i>s name the files or URL references containing the
data to be eyeballed. If several names are given, each is checked individually.

<p>If the URL is of the form <i>ont:NAME:base</i>, then the checked model
is the model <i>base</i> treated as an OntModel with the specification
<code>OntModelSpec.<i>NAME</i></code>. If the URL (or the base)
is of the form <i>jdbc:DB:head:model</i>, then the checked model
is the one called <i>model</i> in the database with connection
<i>jdbc:DB:head</i>. (The database user and password must be specified
independently using the <i>jend.db.user</i> and <i>jena.db.password</i>
system properties.)

<p>If any of the data or schema are identified by an http: URL, and you
are behind a firewall, you will need specify the proxy to Java using
system properties; one way to do this is by using the Java command line
options:

<pre>
    -DproxySet=true
    -DproxyHost=theProxyHostName
    -DproxyPort=theProxyPortNumber
</pre>

<p>The include <i>shortName</i>s are strings which are the 
<code>eye:shortName</code> value of some inspector cluster in
the Eyeball config file; see the config file description for
details. If omitted, it is as if

<pre>
    -include defaultInspectors 
</pre>

had been written. The <code>-exclude</code> option allows the
shortnames of inspectors to be <i>excluded</i> from the checks.
(<i>eg,</i> the type inspector currently slows things down quite
a lot and might well be excluded from an initial eyeballing.)

<p>The eyeball reports are written to the standard output; by default,
the reports appear as text (RDF rendered by omitting the subjects - which
are all blank nodes - and lightly prettifying the predicate and object). 
To change the rendering style, supply the <i>-render</i> option with the 
name of the renderer as its value. Eyeball comes with N3, XML, and text 
renderers; the Eyeball config file associates renderer names with their classes.

<h3>examples of command-line use</h3>

(Assuming an implicit CLASSPATH)

<blockquote>
<pre>
java jena.eyeball -check myDataFile.rdf

java jena.eyeball -assume dc -check http://example.com/nosuch.n3

java jena.eyeball -assume mySchema.rdf -check myData.rdf -render xml

java jena.eyeball -check myData.rdf -include defaultInspectors
</pre>
</blockquote>

<h2>use as a library</h2>

<p>Eyeball can be used from within Java code; the command line
merely provides a convenient external interface.

<h3>creating an Eyeball</h3>

<p>
An Eyeball object has three subcomponents: the assumptions
against which the model is to be checked, the inspectors
which do the checking, and the renderer used to display
the reports.

<p>The assumptions are bundled into a single OntModel.
Multiple assumptions can be supplied either by adding
them as sub-models or by loading their content directly
into the OntModel.

<p>The inspectors are supplied as a single Inspector object.
The method <code>Inspector.Operations.create(List)</code>
creates a single Inspector from a list of Inspectors; this
inspector delegates all its inspection methods to all of
its sub-inspectors.

<p>The renderer can be anything that implements the
(simple) renderer interface.

<p>To create an Eyeball:

<blockquote>
Eyeball eyeball = new Eyeball( inspector, assumptions, renderer );
</blockquote>

<h3>to eyeball a model</h3>

<p>Models to be inspected are provided as OntModels. The problems
are delivered to a Report object, where they are represented as
an RDF model.

<blockquote>
eyeball.inspect( report, ontModelToBeInspected )
</blockquote>

The result is that same report object. The <i>Report::model()</i> method
delivers an RDF model which describes the problems found by the inspection.
The inspections supplied in the distribution use the EYE vocabulary, and
are used in the standard reports:

The prefix <i>eye</i> stands for the URL <i>http://jena.hpl.hp.com/Eyeball#</i>.

<h2>Eyeball configuration</h2>

<h3><a name="load-config-files"></a>configuration files</h3>

The Eyeball command-line utility is configured by files (or URLs)
specified on the command line: their RDF contents are unioned together 
into a single config model. If no config file is specified, then
<i>etc/eyeball-config.n3</i> is loaded.

<p>The configuration file is a Jena assembler description with added
Eyeball vocabulary.

<p>Eyeball is also configured by the location-mapping file <i>etc/location-mapping.n3</i>. 
The Eyeball jar contains copies of both the default config and the location mapper;
these are used by default. You can provide your own <i>etc/eyeball-config.n3</i> 
file earlier on your classpath or in your current directory; this config
replaces the default. You may provide <i>additional</i> location-mapping
files earlier on your classpath or in your current directory. 

<h3>configuring schema names</h3>

To avoid having to quote schema names in full on the Eyeball command
line, (collections of) schemas can be given short names. 

<blockquote>
<pre>
[] eye:shortName <i>shortNameLiteral</i>
    ; eye:schema <i>fullSchemaURL</i>
    ...
    .
</pre>
</blockquote>

A shortname can name several schemas. The Eyeball delivery has
the short names <i>rdf</i>, <i>rdfs</i>, <i>owl</i>, and 
<i>dc</i> for the corresponding schemas (and mirror versions
of those schemas so that they don't need to be downloaded each
time Eyeball is run.)

<h3>configuring inspectors</h3>

The inspectors that Eyeball runs over the model are specfied by
<i>eye:inspector</i> properties of inspector resources. These
resources are identified by <code>eye:shortName</code>s
(supplied on the command line). Each such property value
must be a plain string literal whose value is the full name of
the Inspector class to load and run; see the Javadoc of Inspector
for details.

<p>An inspector resource may refer to other inspector resources
to include their inspectors, using either of the two properties
<code>eye:include</code> or <code>eye:includeByName</code>.
The value of an <code>include</code> property should be another
inspector resource; the value of an <code>includeByName</code>
property should be the <code>shortName</code> of an inspector
resource.

<p>[Two inspector resources may refer to each other, in which 
case they are equivalent.]

<p>The inspectors provided in the Eyeball distribution are:

<table border="1">

    <td>class leafname</td>
    <td>eye:shortName</td>
    <td>description</td>
    </tr>

<tr><td>LiteralInspector

<tr><td>AllTypedInspector
    <td>all-typed

<h3>a note on the ListInspector</h3>

The <i>typed list idiom</i> is boilerplate OWL for defining a
type which is List-of-T for some type T, and looks like:

<pre>
my:EList a owl:Class
    ; rdfs:subClassOf rdf:List
    ; rdfs:subClassOf [owl:onProperty rdf:first; owl:allValuesFrom my:Element]
    ; rdfs:subClassOf [owl:onProperty rdf:rest; owl:allValuesFrom my:EList]
    .
</pre>

The type <code>my:Element</code> is the element type of the list, and
the type <code>EList</code> is the resulting typed list. The list inspector
checks that all the subclasses of <code>rdf:List</code> that are also
subclasses of any bnode that has any property that has as an object
either <code>rdf:first</code> or <code>rdf:rest</code> is a subclass
defined by the full idiom above: if not, it reports it as a
<code>suspectListIdiom</code>.

<h3>a note on the ConsistentTypeInspector</h3>

The ConsistentTypeInspector warns about subjects for which it cannot find a
consistent subtype. By this we mean that when we consider all the
types that it has (explicitly stated or inferred), there is no
type such is a subtype of <i>all</i> of them, assuming that the
type hierarchy in the model is complete. 

<p>For example, if the model contains three types <code>Top</code>,
<code>Left</code>, and <code>Right</code>, with <code>Left</code>
and <code>Right</code> both being subtypes of <code>Top</code>
and with no other subclass statements, then some <code>S</code>
with <code>rdf:type</code>s <code>Left</code> and <code>Right</code>
would generate this warning.

<p>The ConsistentTypeInspector must do at least some type inference. 
This release
of Eyeball compromises by doing RDFS inference augmented by (very)
limited union and intersection reasoning, as described in the Jena
rules in <code>etc/owl-like.rules</code>. Even so, doing type 
inference over a large model is costly; you may wish to suppress it
with <code>-exclude</code> until any other warnings are dealt with.

<p>While, technically, a resource with no attached types at all is
automatically inconsistent, Eyeball quietly ignores such resources,
since they turn up quite often in simple RDF models.

<p><i>Implementation note</i>: The ConsistentTypeInspector's 
inferencing is done entirely by forward rules, triggered on the 
first subject to inspect. Once the rules have run to completion, 
further subjects are cheap. Using backward rules, the initial 
closure of the model was somewhat cheaper, but each new subject 
in a biggish took a long time - a second or so - to process. 

<h3>configuring URI checks</h3>

Eyeball applies some general, configurable, URI checks as well as the
built-in ones. The config file contains statements using the property
<code>eye:schemePattern</code>; their objects must be strings 
which describe a legal (Java regex) pattern for a URI. 
The scheme parts of those patterns form the set of known URI schemes: 
a URI that has that scheme, but does not match any of the patterns 
for that scheme, generates an <code>eye:uriFailsPattern</code> report.

<blockquote>
Eyeball forms a single |-separated Java regular expression from 
all the patterns sharing the same scheme part.
</blockquote>

The currently shipped config file restricts the type-id part of
a URN to containing letters, digits, and hyphens, and to start
with a letter.

<h3>configuring renderers</h3>

The renderer class that Eyeball uses to render the report into text
is giving in the config file by triples of the form:

<blockquote>
<pre>
[]
    eye:renderer FullClassName
    ; eye:shortName ShortClassHandler
</pre>
</blockquote>

The <code>FullClassName</code> is a string literal giving the full
class name of the rendering class. That class must implement the
<i>Renderer</i> interface and have a constructor that takes a
single Model (the configuring model) as an argument.

<p>The <code>ShortClassHandle</code> is a string literal giving
the short name used to refer to the class. The default short name
used is <b>default</b>. There should be no more than one 
<i>eye:shortName</i> statement with the same ShortClassHandle
in the configuation file, but the same class can have many different
short names.

<p>The <code>TextRenderer</code> supports an additional property
<code>eye:labels</code> to allow the appropriate labels for an
ontology to be supplied to the renderer. Each object of a
<code>eye:labels</code> statement names a model; all the 
<code>rdfs:label</code> statements in that model are used
to supply strings which are used to render resources.
</p>

<p>The model names are strings which are interpreted by Jena's
<code>FileManager</code>, so they may be redirected using 
Jena's file mappings.
