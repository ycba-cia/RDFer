<h1>summary</h1>

This document describes Eyeball 1.3. Changes since 1.2, 1.1, and 1.0 
are summarised in the release notes: note that the command-line syntax changed
from 1.0 to 1.1, and that the experimental GUI is not described here.

<h1>Eyeball - checking RDF for common problems</h1>

Eyeball is a library and command-line tool for checking RDF models for 
certain common problems. These problems often result in technically correct 
but implausible RDF. Eyeball checks against user-provided schema files 
and makes various closed-world assumptions.

<p>Eyeball currently can check for:

<ul>
<li>unknown [with respect to the schemas] predicates
<li>bad prefix namespaces
<li>ill-formed URIs [including in datatypes]
<li>ill-formed language tags on literals
<li>unexpected local names in schema namespaces
<li>untyped resources [including literals]
<li>individuals having consistent types assuming complete typing
<li>resources used as classes [objects of rdf:type, rdfs:domain,
    or rdfs:range; objects or subjects of rdfs:subClassOf] 
    but not declared to be classes[ie, not being of rdf:type rdfs:Class].
<li>subjects that have a different number of values for some property 
    than you'd expect from their cardinality-restricted types.
</ul>

We plan to have Eyeball check for:

<ul>
<li>sensible datatypes on literals
<li>user-specified constraints on permitted language codes
<li>user-specified constraints on permitted URIs
<li>user-specified constraints via SPARQL queries
</ul>

Eyeball's checks are performed by Inspector plug-ins and can be customised
by the user. Rendering its reports to output is performed by Renderer
plug-ins which can also be customised by the user.

<h2>installation</h2>

Fetch the Eyeball distribution zipfile and unpack it somewhere convenient.
Read the documention in the doc/index.html file (that's what this is). 
Eyeball 1.3 comes with its own copy of Jena (because it's based on the CVS
version of Jena, 2.3CVS); don't get the two confused.

<p>In the Eyeball distribution directory, run the Eyeball tests:

<blockquote>
ant test 
</blockquote>

If these tests fail, something is wrong. Sometimes it's no more than
a classpath problem, which you can fix. If not, use the jena-dev mailing
list to request assistance. Note that any support is provided on a voluntary 
basis, as and when the effort is available. 

<p>If the tests have passed, you can copy lib/*.jar to whatever place
you find convenient. You can then use it from the command line or from
within Jena code. You will also need to copy the directories <i>mirror</i>
and <i>etc</i> to somewhere convenient where the Jena FileManager class 
can see them.

<h2>command line operation</h2>

You must ensure that the Eyeball jars and the Jena libraries 
-- <i>in that order</i> -- 
are on your classpath. (Note that a CVS version of Eyeball may
come with its own <code>jena.jar</code> and may not work
with your usual installation.)

<p>Run the command:

<blockquote>
<pre>
java [java options eg classpath and proxy] jena.eyeball 
    -assume Reference+  
    -check dataFileOrURL* <b>OR</b> -modelSpec specFileOrURL
    [-config fileOrURL*]
    [-render Name]
    [-inspectors shortName*]
    [-exclude shortName*]
</pre>
</blockquote>

The -whatever sections can come in any order and may be repeated,
in which case the new arguments are appended to the existing ones.

<p>The -config fileOrURL options specify the configuration files to
load. A single configuration model is constructed as the union of the
contents of those files, plus any eye:loadConfig files. If this option
is omitted, the config file etc/eyeball-config.n3 is loaded. See
<a href="#load-config-files">loadConfigFiles</a> for details.

<p>The -assume <i>Reference</i> identifies any assumed schemas used to identify 
the predicates and classes of the data model. The reference may be a
file name, a URL, or the short name of a collection of schemas supplied
in the configuration file.
Several <i>-assume</i> options may be given. Non-option arguments following
<i>-assume</i> will b taken as additional schema.

<p>Eyeball assumes the RDF and RDFS schemas, and the built-in XSD datatype
classes, by default. The short name <i>owl</i> can be used to refer to the 
OWL schema, <i>dc</i> to the Dublin Core schema, <i>dcterms</i> to the 
Dublin Core terms schema,and <i>dc-all</i> to both.
</p>

<p>The <i>dataFileOrURL</i>s name the files or URL references containing the
data to be eyeballed. If several names are given, a combined module containing
all their content is checked. Alternatively, a single modelspec 
<i>specFileOrURL</i> can be provided,
in which case the loaded model is described by the specified Jena Model Spec,
for which see the Jena documentation: this feature is under trial.

<p>If any of the data or schema are identified by an http: URL, and you
are behind a firewall, you will need specify the proxy to Java using
system properties; one way to do this is by using the Java command line
options:

<pre>
    -DproxySet=true
    -DproxyHost=theProxyHostName
    -DproxyPort=theProxyPortNumber
</pre>

<p>The inspectors <i>shortName</i>s are strings which are the 
<code>eye:shortName</code> value of some inspector cluster in
the Eyeball config file; see the config file description for
details. If omitted, it is as if

<pre>
    -inspectors defaultInspectors 
</pre>

had been written. The <code>-exclude</code> option allows the
shortnames of inspectors to be <i>excluded</i> from the checks.
(<i>eg,</i> the type inspector currently slows things down quite
a lot and might well be excluded from an initial eyeballing.)

<p>The eyeball reports are written to the standard output; by default,
the reports appear as text (RDF rendered by omitting the subjects - which
are all blank nodes - and lightly prettifying the predicate and object). 
To change the rendering style, supply the <i>-render</i> option with the 
name of the renderer as its value. Eyeball comes with N3, XML, and text 
renderers; the Eyeball config file associates renderer names with their classes.

<p>To tests models from databases, or with attached reasoners, see the
Jena Model Spec documentation; be warned that this code is changing
at this time.

<h3>examples of command-line use</h3>

(Assuming an implicit CLASSPATH)

<blockquote>
<pre>
java jena.eyeball -assume -check myDataFile.rdf

java jena.eyeball -assume dc -check http://example.com/nosuch.n3

java jena.eyeball -assume mySchema.rdf -check myData.rdf -render xml

java jena.eyeball -check myData.rdf -inspectors defaultInspectors
</pre>
</blockquote>

<h2>use as a library</h2>

<h3>creating an Eyeball</h3>

<p>To create an Eyeball on a particular schema, do:

<blockquote>
Eyeball eyeball = new Eyeball( modelWithSchemaInIt );
</blockquote>

<p>If, instead of a single schema, you have several schemas bundled
together in a <code>List L</code>, you can supply that list
as a <code>SchemaList</code>:

<blockquote>
Eyeball eyeball = new Eyeball( new SchemaList( L ) );
</blockquote>

<p>It is also possible to build a <code>SchemaList</code> one
model at a time, since <code>SchemaList</code> supports
an <code>add(Model)</code> method.

<p>All of these forms use the default list of inspectors. To
supply a non-default list, use:

<blockquote>
Eyeball eyeball = new Eyeball( inspectors, aSchemaList );
</blockquote>

<p>
<code>inspectors</code> must be a list of full classnames of
<code>Inspector</code> classes. To make constructing this list
easier, you can use the method 

<blockquote>
List Eyeball::getInspectors( Model config, List inspect, List except )
</blockquote>

<p>
<code>inspect</code> is a list of shortnames of inspectors to
include, and <code>except</code> is a list of shortnames of
inspectors to exclude, exactly as for the command-line options
(for which this method is the implementation). <code>config</code>
is the config model to use.

<h3>to eyeball a model</h3>

<blockquote>
eyeball.inspect( modelToBeInspected )
</blockquote>

The result is an instance of <i>EyeballReport</i>. The <i>model()</i> method
delivers an RDF model which describes the problems found by the inspection.
The inspections supplied in the distribution use the EYE vocabulary, and
are used in the standard reports:

The prefix <i>eye</i> stands for the URL <i>http://jena.hpl.hp.com/Eyeball#</i>.

<h2>Eyeball configuration</h2>

<h3><a name="load-config-files"></a>configuration files</h3>

The Eyeball command-line utility is configured by files (or URLs)
specified on the command line: their RDF contents are unioned together 
into a single config model. If no config file is specified, then
<i>etc/eyeball-config.n3</i> is loaded. Similarly, in use as a library,
the Eyeball constructor can optionally take a single configuration
Model as argument, and if no such model is supplied, defaults to 
<i>etc/eyeball-config.n3</i>.

<p>Configuration files loaded from the command line may contain statements
with the predicate <code>eye:loadConfig</code>; their objects should
be strings (<i>not</i> URIs) naming other configuration files to
be loaded. This allows a user to extend the default configuration 
without having to modify the default file.

<p>Eyeball is also configured by the location-mapping file <i>etc/location-mapping.n3</i>. 
The Eyeball jar contains copies of both the default config and the location mapper;
these are used by default. You can provide your own <i>etc/eyeball-config.n3</i> 
file earlier on your classpath or in your current directory; this config
replaces the default. You may provide <i>additional</i> location-mapping
files earlier on your classpath or in your current directory. 

<h3>configuring schema names</h3>

To avoid having to quote schema names in full on the Eyeball command
line, (collections of) schemas can be given short names. 

<blockquote>
<pre>
[] eye:shortName <i>shortNameLiteral</i>
    ; eye:schema <i>fullSchemaURL</i>
    ...
    .
</pre>
</blockquote>

A shortname can name several schemas. The Eyeball delivery has
the short names <i>rdf</i>, <i>rdfs</i>, <i>owl</i>, and 
<i>dc</i> for the corresponding schemas (and mirror versions
of those schemas so that they don't need to be downloaded each
time Eyeball is run.)

<h3>configuring inspectors</h3>

The inspectors that Eyeball runs over the model are specfied by
<i>eye:inspector</i> properties of inspector resources. These
resources are identified by <code>eye:shortName</code>s
(supplied on the command line). Each such property value
must be a plain string literal whose value is the full name of
the Inspector class to load and run; see the Javadoc of Inspector
for details.

<p>An inspector resource may refer to other inspector resources
to include their inspectors, using either of the two properties
<code>eye:include</code> or <code>eye:includeByName</code>.
The value of an <code>include</code> property should be another
inspector resource; the value of an <code>includeByName</code>
property should be the <code>shortName</code> of an inspector
resource.

<p>[Two inspector resources may refer to each other, in which 
case they are equivalent.]

<p>The inspectors provided in the Eyeball distribution are:

<table border="1">
<tr>
    <td>class leafname</td>
    <td>eye:shortName</td>
    <td>description</td>
    </tr>

<tr><td>LiteralInspector
    <td>literal
    <td>Checks literals for syntactically correct language codes. 

<tr><td>PredicateInspector
    <td>predicate
    <td>Checks that every predicate used is "declared" in some
        provided schema.

<tr><td>PrefixInspector
    <td>prefix
    <td>Checks that prefix namespaces are well-formed and that
        well-known prefixes have their well-known URIs.

<tr><td>JenaPrefixInspector
    <td>jena-prefix
    <td>Checks for namespace prefixes generated by Jena, 
        <i>ie</i>, those of the form <code>j.N+</code>.

<tr><td>URIInspector
    <td>URI
    <td>Checks that every URI in the model is well-formed.

<tr><td>VocabularyInspector
    <td>vocabulary
    <td>Checks that every URI in the model whose namespace is
        mentioned in some schema is one of the URIs declared
        in the schema. [This one needs a bit of work ...] 

<tr><td>AllTypedInspector
    <td>all-typed
    <td>checks that all URI and bnode resources in the model
        have an rdf:type property in the model or the schema(s).
        If there is a statement in the confiuration with
        property <code>eye:checlLiteralTypes</code> and
        value <code>eye:true</code>, also checks that every
        literal has a type or a language. <i>Not</i> in the
        default set of inspectors.
        
<tr><td>ConsistentTypeInspector
    <td>consistent-type
    <td>Checks that every subject in the model can be given a
        type which is the intersection of the subclasses of all
        its "attached" types. <i>See below</i>.
        
<tr><td>PresumedClassInspector
    <td>presumed-class
    <td>Checks that every resource in the model that appears
        as the object of an <code>rdf:type</code>, 
        <code>rdfs:domain</code>, or <code>rdfs:range</code> statement,
        or as the subject or object of an <code>rdfs:subClassOf</code>
        statement, has been declared as a <code>Class</code> in
        the schemas or the modeul under test. <i>Note:</i>
        OWLification coming soon.
        
<tr><td>CardinalityInspector
    <td>cardinality
    <td>Looks for classes <i>C</i> that are subclasses of cardinality
        restrictions on some property <i>P</i> with cardinality range
        <i>min</i> to <i>max</i>. For any <i>X</i> of <code>rdf:type</code>
        <i>C</i>, it checks that the number of values of <i>P</i> is
        in the range <i>min..max</i> and geenrates a report if it isn't.
        (Doesn't account for <code>owl:sameAs</code> in the 1.2 release.)

<h3>a note on the ConsistentTypeInspector</h3>

The ConsistentTypeInspector warns about subjects for which it cannot find a
consistent subtype. By this we mean that when we consider all the
types that it has (explicitly stated or inferred), there is no
type such is a subtype of <i>all</i> of them, assuming that the
type hierarchy in the model is complete. 

<p>For example, if the model contains three types <code>Top</code>,
<code>Left</code>, and <code>Right</code>, with <code>Left</code>
and <code>Right</code> both being subtypes of <code>Top</code>
and with no other subclass statements, then some <code>S</code>
with <code>rdf:type</code>s <code>Left</code> and <code>Right</code>
would generate this warning.

<p>The ConsistentTypeInspector must do at least some type inference. 
This release
of Eyeball compromises by doing RDFS inference augmented by (very)
limited union and intersection reasoning, as described in the Jena
rules in <code>etc/owl-like.rules</code>. Even so, doing type 
inference over a large model is costly; you may wish to suppress it
with <code>-exclude</code> until any other warnings are dealt with.

<p>While, technically, a resource with no attached types at all is
automatically inconsistent, Eyeball quietly ignores such resources,
since they turn up quite often in simple RDF models.

<p><i>Implementation note</i>: The ConsistentTypeInspector's 
inferencing is done entirely by forward rules, triggered on the 
first subject to inspect. Once the rules have run to completion, 
further subjects are cheap. Using backward rules, the initial 
closure of the model was somewhat cheaper, but each new subject 
in a biggish took a long time - a second or so - to process. 

<h3>configuring URI checks</h3>

Eyeball applies some general, configurable, URI checks as well as the
built-in ones. The config file contains statements using the property
<code>eye:schemePattern</code>; their objects must be strings 
which describe a legal (Java regex) pattern for a URI. 
The scheme parts of those patterns form the set of known URI schemes: 
a URI that has that scheme, but does not match any of the patterns 
for that scheme, generates an <code>eye:uriFailsPattern</code> report.

<blockquote>
Eyeball forms a single |-separated Java regular expression from 
all the patterns sharing the same scheme part.
</blockquote>

The currently shipped config file restricts the type-id part of
a URN to containing letters, digits, and hyphens, and to start
with a letter.

<h3>configuring renderers</h3>

The renderer class that Eyeball uses to render the report into text
is giving in the config file by triples of the form:

<blockquote>
<pre>
[]
    eye:renderer FullClassName
    ; eye:shortName ShortClassHandler
</pre>
</blockquote>

The <code>FullClassName</code> is a string literal giving the full
class name of the rendering class. That class must implement the
<i>Renderer</i> interface and have a constructor that takes a
single Model (the configuring model) as an argument.

<p>The <code>ShortClassHandle</code> is a string literal giving
the short name used to refer to the class. The default short name
used is <b>default</b>. There should be no more than one 
<i>eye:shortName</i> statement with the same ShortClassHandle
in the configuation file, but the same class can have many different
short names.
