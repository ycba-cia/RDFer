   <div class="description item vcard"><p><span class="fn org">Crepes on Cole</span> is one of the best little 
      creperies in <span class="adr"><span class="locality">San Francisco</span></span>.
      Excellent food and service. Plenty of tables in a variety of sizes
      for parties large and small.  Window seating makes for excellent
      people watching to/from the N-Judah which stops right outside.
      I've had many fun social gatherings here, as well as gotten
      plenty of work done thanks to neighborhood WiFi.</p></div>
