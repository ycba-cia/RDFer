Any23 Plugins

* Introduction

    This section describes the <Any23> initial support for plugins.

    <Any23> cames with a set of predefined plugins. Plugins are located
    under <any23-root>/plugins dir.

    Every plugin is a standard Maven2 module implementing at least the <ExtractorPlugin> interface.

    Currently it is possible to add only new <Extractor>s.

* How to Build a Plugin

   <Any23> takes care to build and test plugins when distributed from its reactor pom.
   It is aways possible to rebuild a plugin using the command:

+--------------------------------------
  <plugin-dir>$ mvn clean compile
+--------------------------------------

* How to Add a Plugin

   A plugin can be added to <Any23> simply adding its JAR to the Any23 classpath.
   <Any23> will auto detect the plugin and will register it to the extractors list.

* How to Write a Plugin

   Currently only Extractors can be defined as plugin. To declare a new plugin it
   is needed to implement the {{{ExtractorPlugin}}} interface and to annotate the
   implementation with the {{{net.xeoh.plugins.base.annotations.@PluginImplementation}}}
   annotation. An example of plugin is defined below.

+--------------------------------------
  @PluginImplementation
  @Author(name="Michele Mostarda (mostarda@fbk.eu)")
  public class HTMLScraperPlugin implements ExtractorPlugin {

    private static final Logger logger = LoggerFactory.getLogger(HTMLScraperPlugin.class);

    @Init
    public void init() {
        logger.info("Plugin initialization.");
    }

    @Shutdown
    public void shutdown() {
        logger.info("Plugin shutdown.");
    }

    public ExtractorFactory getExtractorFactory() {
        return HTMLScraperExtractor.factory;
    }

  }
+--------------------------------------
